# Overview

- This workshop will introduce you to *__Jupyter Notebooks__*. You will learn what they are, what they do and why you might like to use them. 
- It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, have little or no knowledge of coding and computational methods in research. 
- By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what notebooks can do, how to open one up, *__perform some basic tasks__* and save it for later.

# Introduction

- A notebook interface, the concept is that it is a virtual notebook environment used for literate programming. 
- *__Literate programming__* pairs the functionality of word processing software with both the shell and kernel of that notebook's programming language. 
- Notebooks are *__documents that contain both code and rich text elements__*, such as links, equations and different ways of visualising data via graphs, tables and figures. 
- Notebooks are really smart documents - they can be executed to perform the data analysis in real time.

# Jupyter Notebooks

- Jupyter is named after three computer programming languages - *__Julia__*, *__Python__* and *__R__*. 
- They offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing.
- It's a like a mix between the *__command line__* and a *__word processor__*. 

# What can Jupyter Notebooks do?


- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Numerical simulation
- Statistical modeling
- *__Visualisation__*

These tools are very helpful for exploration as well as demonstration.


# Why use Jupyter Notebooks?

- They are great for exploration in data analysis, presenting results, and sharing ideas. 
- Jupyter Notebooks are also *__great at performing rapid visualisations__* that you can test out, change and share easily. 
- They are also freely available and you can use them in a *__normal browser__*.
- Offer a way to experiment with data processing *__without having to be a programmer__*. 
- Notebooks permit a quick set of steps: you can document and run code then look at code outcome, e.g. equations or visualisations, all in one place.
- They also help you keep track of your methods so you have a record of how you performed an analysis and came up with a conclusion. 


# What makes them different to other applications?

- Code: *__Running code__* means making the computer do what you are telling it to do. "Executing code" is the same thing.
- Output:  is *__the result__* of the computational process, such as a visualisation, graph, model, equation and so on.
- Jupyter notebooks are a series of *__cells__* containing executable code and outputs. 


# Short summary

- A notebook can either run *__on your desktop__* with no internet or on a remote server *__via the internet__*
- A notebook runs and stores the code and output, with markdown notes
- A notebook is an *__editable document__* with input and output cells
